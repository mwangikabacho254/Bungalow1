# Revit Electrical Modeling â€“ Personal Learning Journey

Welcome to my journey of mastering Revit for Electrical Design. This repository documents my practical learning process, experiments, and real-world-style electrical modeling tasks. I'm currently exploring how to digitally design and document MEP systems with precision.

---
## Current Focus Areas
- Electrical device placement (sockets, lights, cooker units, CCTV, switches)
- Wiring to panels and device circuits
- Visibility control (hiding levels, room tags, etc.)
- Setting up views for electrical layout clarity
- Using conduits for power and lighting distribution
- Annotation and documentation practices

---

## Completed Tasks
- Placed lighting fixtures and sockets  
- Connected sockets and lights to distribution panel  
- Adjusted visibility settings to optimize 3D and 2D views  
- Hid room tags and levels to declutter layouts  
- Learned how to rotate and align fixtures

## Next Steps

- Lay conduits accurately (power, lighting, data)  
- Add junction boxes, surface-mount and concealed conduit runs  
- Create schedules for electrical systems  
- Begin modeling smart features (e.g., automation-ready layouts)

## Tools Used
- Autodesk Revit 2026  
- Custom .RFA families (in progress)  
- GitHub for tracking learning and asset organization
